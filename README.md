# Covid19 Tweets analysis
There are Millions of tweets about Covid19 so far which makes sense, itâ€™s a game changer event for humanity today. People are losing lives or their loved ones to this pandemic, worried, anxious and constantly imagining how their lives could possibly be more impacted by it. People tweeting official or unofficial statement disclose a lot of emotions associated with the event.

The world is changing, and Corona will always have a huge role in how the world of tomorrow will operate. Whether its students choosing to study through online programs, employees opting to work from home, people facing anxiety issues, or companies facing issues in not meeting the cleaning equipment demand. It all begins from the pivotal point i.e. problems being faced by people today. I try to identify these problems and perform exploratory analysis using the tweets.
